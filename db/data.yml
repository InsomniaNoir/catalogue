    - Prior Authorization
    - Florida Blue requires you or your physician to get Prior Authorization for certain
      drugs. This means if you do not get an approval from us prior to filling your
      prescription, we may not cover the drug.

    - Quantity Limits
    - For certain drugs, there are limits to the amount of the drug Florida Blue will
      cover. We may limit how many refills you can get or how much of a drug you can
      get each time you fill your prescription.

    - Step Therapy
    - In some cases, Florida Blue requires you to try certain drugs before we will
      cover another drug for that condition. For example, if Drug A and Drug B both
      treat your medical condition, our plan may not cover Drug B unless you try Drug
      A first. If Drug A does not work for you, our plan will then cover Drug B.

    - Formulary Exception
    - "Asking for coverage of a drug that is not on the Drug List is called asking
      for a “Formulary Exception\". If an exception is approved to cover a drug that
      is not on the Drug List, you will pay the copay amount that applies to drugs
      in Tier 4/Non-Preferred Brand `<or other Tier listed in the BET>` Drugs. You
      cannot ask for an exception to the copayment or coinsurance amount we require
      you to pay for the drug.\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n"

    - Tier Exception
    - Asking to pay a lower preferred price for a covered non-preferred drug is sometimes
      called asking for a “Tier Exception". If your drug is a ```<Tier 4/Non-Preferred
      Brand Drug or Tier 2/Non-Preferred Generic Drug>```, you can ask for it to be
      covered at the cost-sharing amount that applies to drugs in ```<Tier 3/Preferred
      Brand Drugs or Tier 1/Preferred Generic Drugs>```. This would lower your share
      of the cost for the drug. You cannot ask for a change in the cost-sharing tier
      for any drug in Tier 5/Specialty Drugs.

    - Cost of Meds
    - We encourage you to confirm the cost for your drugs prior to placing an order
      with PrimeMail® or filling a prescription at a retail pharmacy. If you would
      like to know if a drug is covered or determine pricing, you can contact a Member
      Service Agent at the number provided on the back of your insurance card. A Member
      Service Agent can help you find the copay for each of your prescriptions using
      pharmacies of your choice. You may also obtain price estimates for drugs on
      the web at www.bluemedicarefl.com. *Please Note* Price estimates are based on
      your benefits and can vary depending on the quantity dispensed and how the prescription
      is written. You can also refer to your Drug List booklet for copay information.

    - Deductible
    - "The Deductible Stage is the first stage for your drug coverage. The deductible
      is the amount you must pay for your prescription drugs before your plan begins
      to pay its share. It begins when you `<fill your first prescription for the
      year>` `<fill your first prescription that is a [Indicate Applicable Tiers]>`
      . You will pay the full cost of your drugs until you pay the plan's deductible
      amount, which is $***.** for `<plan year>`. Once the deductible is paid you

    - The transit time for your PrimeMail order may vary based on how the order was
      shipped and your location. PrimeMail uses the United States Postal Service and
      the United Parcel Service for its shipments. Once the order is shipped, a tracking
      number should be available. You can check your order status at MyPrimeMail.com

    - Employer Group Waiver Program (EGWP)
    - "\"According to your 2014 benefits, you were enrolled in a special Medicare-based
      program called an Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP). In 2014, your Employer
      Group Waiver Plan (EGWP) cost share (flat copay) was compared to a typical Medicare
      Part D plan cost share (25% co-insurance of the approved drug cost). The lower
      cost share amount between the two amounts was what you paid. This means the
      amount you paid in 2014 for prescription claims may have been lower than the
      flat copays selected by your Employer Group. That changed in 2015. \r\n\r\nEffective
      1/1/2015, your EGWP plan does not compare to a typical Medicare Part D plan.
      This means the amount you will pay in 2015 for prescription claims will be the
      flat copays selected by your Employer Group, which may be a higher amount than
      what you paid in 2014. You will never pay more than the total approved cost
      for a covered drug processed through insurance. If the total approved cost of
      a drug is less than your copay while in the Initial Coverage Stage, you will
      pay the total approved cost of the drug.\""
